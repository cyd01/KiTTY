## How to compile
Inside your MSYS & MinGW32 environment jump into the x.yy_My_PuTTY\windows directory then run the command:

    make -f MAKEFILE.MINGW putty.exe

### How to install the MSYS/MinGW32 environment
Simple guide to setup the compile environment:

- Download the `mingw-builds-install.exe` from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbuilds/files/host-windows/releases/4.8.0/32-bit/
- Execute the installer and select the **GUI**.
- After installing it, only the "packager manager" it's in fact installed, so execute `$MinGW\libexec\mingw-get\guimain.exe` and select in the Basic Setup the packages: **"mingwg-developer-tools", "mingw32-base", "mingw32-gcc-g++" and "msys-base"**.
- When all is installed, to open the SHELL execute `$MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat`. Then from from this shell you can compile. Example: `cd $KiTTY_DIR/0.74_My_PuTTY/windows` and `make -f MAKEFILE.MINGW 9bis`.
